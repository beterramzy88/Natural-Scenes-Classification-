# Natural-Scenes-Classification-
# Overview
This GitHub repository contains Deep learning models to classify Natural-Scenes images and compare models
# About Dataset
images of Natural Scenes around the world.

This Data contains around 24k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories: Buildings, Forest, Glacier, Mountain, Sea, Street. 

The Train, Test and Prediction data is separated in each zip file. There are around 14k images in Train, 3k in Test and 7k in Prediction. 

Train Folder to train model 

Test Folder to evaluate model 

Prediction Folder to make predictions on new, unseen data.

# Steps

## 1- Data preprocessing 
  preprocess data to make images suitable to use in models, preprocessing like resizing and normalizing images 

## 2- AlexNet model implementaion and evalute it on test data

## 3- using transefer learning on VGG model 

## 4- using transefer learning on Resnet model

## 5- using transefer learning on inception model 
 
## 6- comparing between models
